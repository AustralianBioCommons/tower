If you would like to register your interest to participate in the pilot project and explore the community workspace, please familiarise yourself with the prerequisites checklist below and complete this [**expression of interest registration form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScVFzZXYyFf-3oRaNp4674R1001hp3M0F673tr6zGM6wHsgFA/viewform?usp=sf_link) and a member of the project team will be in contact with you to discuss this further. Otherwise, you can access a personal workspace by login into the service at this [link](https://tower.services.biocommons.org.au). Personal workspaces are not supported by the Australian BioCommons at this stage.  

## Prerequisite list

1. **Access to compute infrastructure**

    The community should have access to at least one compute infrastructure that will be configured on the BioCommons Tower service. There are several supported platforms on Tower and you can find them here.

2. **Nextflow pipelines**

    The community should have nextflow pipelines implemented and tested on the compute environments (from 1). Internally implemented pipelines, those reused from nf-core or any other resources are ok.
    Preference: Implementation of config profiles that allows conda and docker executions for portability purposes.

3. **Testing datasets**

    For any suggested pipeline, there should be some testing datasets available during the deployment on Tower. This should include small datasets for quick testing and real datasets for production testing.

4. **Nextflow expertise**

    The deployment and configuration of compute environments and pipelines should be led and driven by the community/organisation.  This requires the organisation/community to have dedicated resources with technical expertise in nextflow, and infrastructure expertise, including HPC and commercial cloud (depending on the case).

    The dedicated resource with relevant expertise might need to do the following:

    - Implement changes to the pipeline (usually edits to the configuration profiles).
    - Configure, test and debug the pipelines on the community infrastructures.
    - Understand the available computational resources they access.
    - Might require admin access to the compute infrastructure.
    - Manage user access to the community/organisation workspace.

    The BioCommons will provide all possible support with respect to the available resources.
