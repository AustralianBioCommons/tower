# Configure and use compute environments

Tower supports running pipelines on several compute platforms including commercial cloud such as AWS and Azure, as well as high-performance computer (HPC). A full list of supported platforms is available through [Tower documenation] (https://help.tower.nf/latest/compute-envs/overview/). 

To access these compute infrastructures, compute environments need to be created and configured on Tower for each compute infrastructure.
