## Create and access a personal workspace

By default, each user on the Australian BioCommon Nextflow Tower service will have their own personal workspace which can be accessed directly after logging into the service. No need to contact the Australian BioCommons to use your own personal workspace. This model is not supported by the Australian BioCommons at this stage, and users are responsible to configure and use their personal workspace.


## Create and access an organisation / group / institutional workspace

Accessing an organisation workspace requires joining the [pilot project of the Australian Nextflow Tower Service](/main/join_us.md) as described.

Under the pilot project, you can:

1. Create workspaces for your community

2. Contact the Australian BioCommons to arrange a new workspace for your organisation, group or institution.

3. Log in to the Australian BioCommons Tower service and share your email with the BioCommons.

4. The Australian BioCommons will create a workspace for you and add you as an administrator to the workspace.

5. You can add other users to your workspace by following the instructions at (Join an existing workspace below)

## Join an existing organisation workspace

1. The user who needs to access a workspace should log in to the Australian BioCommons Tower service. 

2. The email address used in the userâ€™s login should then be shared with the admin of the workspace and the admin can add the user directly as described in Tower documentation here. This should be done under the participants' tab in the workspace rather than the organisation.

## Managing participants' access to organisation workspace

Visit [Tower documentation](https://help.tower.nf/latest/orgs-and-teams/workspace-management/#participant-roles) to learn more about different access roles that can be assigned to workspace participants. This will allow for better management of resources and minimise risks.
